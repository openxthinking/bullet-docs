# Customization
Here's how to customize the basic look and feel of your online store, you can customize the theme to suit your unique brand.

## Backup
?> Before you customize your theme, it's best practice to duplicate your theme to create a backup copy. This makes it easy to discard your changes and start again if you need to.

1. Click `Actions` then `Duplicate`

## Intro
Get familiar with the Theme Editor:

### Theme settings
You can edit your theme settings to customize your online store's content, layout, typography, and colors. Each theme provides settings that allow you to change the look and feel of your store without editing any code.

### Theme Editor
