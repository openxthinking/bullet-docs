## Partner access
Here's how to give OpenThinking access to your store.

1. All you've to do is provide us with your Shopify store URL: e.g. `your-store.myshopify.com`
1. Once the URL is provided we'll submit the request to access your store, you'll receive an email and a notification on your Shopify Home. Please accept it!

#### **FAQ**

- Q: __I accidentally rejected the request, how can I get it back?__
- A: If you rejected the request please contact us again so we can contact "Shopify Partner Support" and let them unlock our account so that we can send you another request.


- Q: __What should I do when I'm finished working with OpenThinking?__
- A: If you don't need any more help from us, you can then delete our account. (see how in the "Delete OpenThinking" tab)

#### **Delete OpenThinking**

!> **Important** This action cannot be undone

Delete OpenThinking account:
1. Log in as the store owner.
1. From your Shopify admin, click Settings, and then click Plan and permissions.
1. In the Collaborators section, click on `OpenThinking`.
1. In the Remove collaborator account section, click Delete collaborator account or Remove collaborator account.
1. In the confirmation dialog, click Delete.


Once our account is permanently deleted from your store it no longer appears in the "Collaborators list" on your "Plan and permissions" page and we can no longer access your store. If you want to give us access again, then you must ask us to resend you the collaborator request.
