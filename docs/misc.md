#### **FAQ**

Q: I accidentally rejected the request, how can I get it back?

A: If you rejected the request please contact us again so we can contact "Shopify Partner Support" and let them unlock our account so that we can send you another request.



Q: What should I do when I'm finished working with you?

A: If you don't need any more help from us, you can then delete our account (See how in the "Steps tab"). This action cannot be undone.

#### **Steps**

Delete our account:
- Log in as the store owner.
- From your Shopify admin, click Settings, and then click Plan and permissions.
- In the Collaborators section, click the collaborator's name.
- In the Remove collaborator account section, click Delete collaborator account or Remove collaborator account.
- In the confirmation dialog, click Delete.
