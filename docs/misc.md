## Partner access
Here's how to give OpenThinking access to your store.

1. All you've to do is provide us with your Shopify store URL: e.g. `your-store.myshopify.com`.
1. Once the URL is provided we'll submit the request to access your store, you'll receive an email and a notification on your Shopify Home. Please accept it!
