# Setup
Here's a quick setup you need to do before moving to the customization of your website.

## Pages
The first thing you need to is to create your pages.

### Create
Our themes come with special "pre-built layouts for common pages such as _Contact, About, FAQs, Legal, Press_. Follow the steps below to set up your page.

__Step 1__: Create the page
  1. From your Shopify admin, go to [Online Store > Pages](https://www.shopify.com/admin/pages?ref=OpenThinking).
  2. Click `Add page`
  3. Insert a Title and Short description for your page ⚠️ (used for SEO! _the actual content is added in Step 2)_
  5. Select a template for your page: `page.about`, `page.contact` etc.
  6. Click `Save`.

__Step 2__: Add the content
  1. From your Shopify admin, go to [Online Store > Themes](https://www.shopify.com/admin/themes?ref=OpenThinking).
  2. Click `Customize`
  3. Navitage to the page you've just created (e.g. About)
  4. In the `Sections` bar, on the left, click on `Name page` (e.g. About page)
  5. Enter your info
  6. Click `Save`

?> Even if your new webpage is visible, it won't appear in your online store's navigation automatically. You'll need to add a link to it in a menu manually.
