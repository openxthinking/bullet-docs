## General

## Pages

### About & Contact pages
Add "About us" and "Contact us" information pages to your store

If you have information that you want your customers to know about that won't change often, for example, details about your organization or the contact information for your store, then you can create pages for your store to give that content a permanent location.

1. From your Shopify admin, go to [Online Store > Pages](https://www.shopify.com/admin/pages?ref=OpenThinking).
2. Click `Add page`
3. In the webpage editor, enter a Title and Content in the text boxes provided.
4. Be descriptive and clear when choosing your webpage title. The webpage title is displayed in the tab or title bar of browsers. It is also used as the title in search engine results. Learn more about website SEO.
5. Click Save.

>  Even if your new webpage is visible, it won't appear in your online store navigation automatically. You'll need to add a link to it in a menu.


### Legal
Display your store policies and other legal information. 

Adding store policies automatically adds a link to them in your checkout pages. However, creating new pages for your legal policies and linking them to your footer ensures that customers can view legal policies on any page of your online store.

1. From your Shopify admin, go to [Online Store > Pages](https://www.shopify.com/admin/pages?ref=OpenThinking).
2. Click `Add page`.
3. Enter a Title in the text box. Paste your legal policies into the Content text box provided.
4. Click `Save`
