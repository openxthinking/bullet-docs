## Pages

OpenThinking themes come with custom layouts for common pages such as _Contact, About, FAQs, Brands_ etc. Follow these steps to set up your pages.


### Create

#### 1. Create page

  1. From Shopify admin, go to [Online Store > Pages](https://www.shopify.com/admin/pages?ref=openthinking1&utm_campaign=docs).
  1. Click `Add page`
  1. Insert a "Title" and "Short description" for your page ⚠️ (used for SEO! _the actual content is added in Step 2)_
  1. Select a template for your page: `page.about`, `page.contact` etc.
  1. Click `Save`.

#### 2. Add the content

  1. From Shopify admin, go to [Online Store > Themes](https://www.shopify.com/admin/themes?ref=openthinking1&utm_campaign=docs).

## Navigation

After you add pages, products and create collections, webpages, store policies, or blog posts, you need to organize them on your online store so that customers will be able to find them.

You can view and change your online store navigation from the [Online store > Navigation](https://www.shopify.com/admin/menus?ref=openthinking1&utm_campaign=docs) page in your Shopify admin.

By default OpenThinking themes use the `Main menu` to display links in theme's header main navigation. 


### Add link to navigation

1. From Shopify admin, go to [Online store > Navigation](https://www.shopify.com/admin/menus?ref=openthinking1&utm_campaign=docs).
2. On the Navigation page, click the `Main menu`.
3. Click `Add menu item`.
4. Enter a `name` for the menu item. This name displays in the menu, and can include special characters or emoji.
5. Click the `Link` field, and then enter a website address for an external website or select a link type:


| Title           | Description                              |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Home**        | your online store's home page            |
| **Collections** | a specific collection or all collections |
| **Products**    | a specific product or all products       |
| **Pages**       | a webpage on your online store           |

| **Blog posts**  | a blog post on your online store         |
| **Policies**    | one of your store policies               |


> If you selected a collection or all collections, then you can filter the collection with tags to display only the products that match all of the tags that you enter.

> If you selected a link type, then select a specific destination. When you select `Home`, the destination is automatically set to your online store's home page.

6. Click `Add` to add your menu item.
7. Click `Save menu`.
