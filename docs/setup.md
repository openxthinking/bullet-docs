  1. Click `Add a page`
  1. Insert a "Title" and "Short description" for your page ⚠️ (used for SEO! _the actual content is added in Step 2)_
  1. Select a template for your page: `page.about`, `page.contact` etc.
  1. Click `Save`.

## Navigation

After you add pages, and products and create collections, webpages, store policies, or blog posts, you need to organize them on your online store so that customers will be able to find them.

You can view and change your online store navigation from the [Online store > Navigation](https://www.shopify.com/admin/menus?ref=openthinking1&utm_campaign=docs) page in your Shopify admin.

By default, OpenThinking themes use the `Main menu` to display links in the theme's header main navigation. 


### Add link to navigation

1. From Shopify admin, go to [Online store > Navigation](https://www.shopify.com/admin/menus?ref=openthinking1&utm_campaign=docs).
2. On the Navigation page, click the `Main menu`.
3. Click `Add menu item`.
4. Enter a `name` for the menu item. This name displays in the menu and can include special characters or emojis.
5. Click the `Link` field, and then enter a website address for an external website or select a link type:


| Title           | Description                              |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Home**        | your online store's home page            |

| **Policies**    | one of your store policies               |


> If you selected a collection or all collections, then you can filter the collection with tags to display only the products that match all of the tags that you enter.

> If you selected a link type, then choose a specific destination. When you select `Home`, the destination is automatically set to your online store's home page.
