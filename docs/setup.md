The first thing you need to do is to create your pages.

### Create
Our themes come with special "pre-built layouts for common pages such as _Contact, About, FAQs, Legal, Press_. Follow the steps below to set up your page.

__Step 1__: Create the page
  1. From your Shopify admin, go to [Online Store > Pages](https://www.shopify.com/admin/pages?ref=openthinking1&utm_campaign=docs).
  2. Click `Add page`
  3. Insert a Title and Short description for your page ⚠️ (used for SEO! _the actual content is added in Step 2)_
  5. Select a template for your page: `page.about`, `page.contact` etc.
  6. Click `Save`.

__Step 2__: Add the content
  1. From your Shopify admin, go to [Online Store > Themes](https://www.shopify.com/admin/themes?ref=openthinking1&utm_campaign=docs).
  2. Click `Customize`
  3. Navitage to the page you've just created (e.g. About)

?> Even if your new webpage is visible, it won't appear in your online store's navigation automatically. You'll need to add a link to it in a menu manually.
