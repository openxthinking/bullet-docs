# Theme updates

Themes only update automatically when you or an installed app haven't made any code changes to your theme, and the theme update doesn't introduce new settings. This is because automatic updates remove custom code changes. 

!> If you want to update your theme but have edited the code or installed an app that has changed the code, then you need to manually add an updated version of the theme to your online store.

?> If do not know how to do it and still want to update your theme contact whomever modified the theme's code for you, they will handle it.


## Update

#### step 1. Backup your theme
!> Before you customize a theme, make a backup copy so that you can discard your changes and start again if you need to.

1. From your `Shopify admin`, go to `Online Store > Themes`
1. Locate the theme you want to duplicate, click `Actions > Duplicate`


#### step 2. Add an updated version of your theme to your online store
1. Visit the [Shopify Theme Store](https://themes.shopify.com/?ref=openthinking1) and `log in`. 
⚠️ It is important to log in to the account that you used to buy the theme. This will prevent you from being asked to buy the theme again.
1. Use the top bar search box and search: `OpenThinking` or [click here](https://themes.shopify.com/themes?q=OpenThinking&ref=openthinking1)
1. On the search results page, click your `OpenThinking` theme.
1. Click `Add latest theme version` or `Add theme`.

!> When you manually add an updated version of a theme, a second version of the theme is added to your online store. The new version is in its default state, with none of your customizations applied. The older version is unaffected by the update, and still has all of your code customizations.

#### step 3. After you add an updated theme
1. Customize your theme by using the theme editor.
1. `Uninstall` any apps that add code to a theme, and then re-install them from the [Shopify App Store](https://apps.shopify.com/?ref=openthinking1). If you're not sure whether an app needs to be re-installed, then contact the app developer for support. To contact the app developer, find the app on the [Apps page](https://shopify.com/admin/apps?ref=openthinking1) of your `Shopify admin`, and then click `Get support`.
