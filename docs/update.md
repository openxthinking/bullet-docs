# Theme updates

?> When no code changes have been made to your theme (by you or any installed apps) and no new settings have been added, Shopify themes will only update automatically.

?> Shopify isn't designed to transfer over certain setups and settings, therefore the only way to get past this is to manually go through and update each setting one by one.

?> It's also important to note that any modifications you or a developer made to the theme code will need to be manually transferred into the updated version. The developer's customizations might need to be modified because the theme code might have changed in the upgrade.

## Step 1: Update
Obtain the latest theme version.

### Via Shopify admin
If you purchase your theme through the official Shopify theme store, you will be notified that a new version is available directly in your Shopify admin area.

1. From Shopify admin, go to `Online Store → Themes`
1. Locate `Bullet`, then click <span style="color:#458FFF;font-size:3rem;line-height:0;position:relative;top:7px">&bull;</span> Bullet version x.y.z available.

1. Click <kbd>Add to theme library</kbd>
1. This will install a “fresh” copy of the theme in an unpublished state on your store. 


!> When you manually add an updated version of a theme, a second version of the theme is added to your online store. The new version is in its default state, with none of your customizations applied. The older version is unaffected by the update, and still has all of your code customizations.

### Via Shopify theme store
A new version message may occasionally not appear in the Shopify admin area. Take these actions if this is the case.

1. Visit the [Shopify Theme Store](https://themes.shopify.com/themes?q=OpenThinking) and click <kbd>Log in</kbd>. 
⚠️ It is important to log in to the account that you used to purchase the theme. This will prevent you from being asked to purchase the theme again.
1. Use the top search bar and search: `OpenThinking` or [click here](https://themes.shopify.com/themes?q=OpenThinking)
1. From there, select your `OpenThinking` theme.
1. Click <kbd>Add latest theme version</kbd> or&nbsp; <kbd>Add theme</kbd>
1. This will install a “fresh” copy of the theme in an unpublished state on your store.

## Step 2: Set up
While some basic information, such as your store name, collections, and product names will appear in this version if you preview it using the <kbd>actions</kbd> menu for the unpublished version, you’ll likely notice that your theme is in its default state.

You’ll need to go through and manually customize your theme again, and select options such as fonts and other settings within the Theme editor under <kbd>Customize</kbd> — as well as rebuild any sections.

## Step 3: Publish
Test the new theme extensively and make sure everything works as expected. Once you're ready, simply publish the new theme as the main theme.

?> We highly recommend you to not delete the old theme and to keep it two or three months, so that you can always go back to the old one if something bad happen.
